# @4mbl/css-reset

> Easy CSS reset.

## Installation

You can either install the npm package directly, or use a CDN like [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/).

### Using npm package

1. Install the [`@4mbl/css-reset`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@4mbl/css-reset) npm package.

    ```shell
    npm install @4mbl/css-reset
    ```

2. Import the CSS reset file in your main CSS file.

    ```css
    @import '@4mbl/css-reset/reset.css';
    ```

    Or include it directly in a HTML file.

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@4mbl/css-reset/reset.css" />
    ```

### Using CDN

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.unpkg.com/@4mbl/css-reset@latest/reset.css" />
```

You should replace "latest" in the URL with the newest version to avoid breaking changes in the future!

## Available branches

There is currently only one branch available, but more might be added in the future.

## Versioning

As there is only one branch available, the package and branch versioning are the same.

Each change to the CSS reset increments the major version. This might change if a new branch is added in the future.
